    <p>Here's a random assortment of stuff I like to spend my time doing.</p>

    <ol type="I">
      <li><b>Tabletop and Roleplaying games.</b></li>
      <p>I'm kind of a big old nerd when it comes to this type of stuff. Can't resist a good setting, fun characters and a bunch of friend sseated on the table laughing as they forge a tale (even thoough most of the time I'm the dungeon master, <em>sigh.</em>)</p>
      <li><b>Cooking.</b></li>
      <p>I'm <em>really</em> into eating, but I tend to complain about most things that I dont cook (even if the meal presented looks nice and is delicious) so it onnly makes sense I'd be <em>really</em> into cooking.</p>
      <li><b>Gaming.</b></li>
      <p>Mostly old school CRPGs, like the classic Fallout 1 and 2, altough I indulge in more modern stuff from time to time since my rig can runsome newer games now.</p>
